This is a console based snake game that was made in **C++** for **Linux** (not Windows). It uses **ncurses** for drawing.

I think it is beautiful.

# How to install?
The first step: download repository `git clone https://github.com/valixxx1/snake_game`<br>
If you have processor x64 and Ubuntu OS, try to run **snake** file `./snake`<br>
Else:
1. Make sure you have **make** util `sudo apt install make`
2. Also pay attention that you need have g++ `sudo apt install g++`
3. Compile files with command `make`
4. Run the game `./snake`

Press WASD for changing snake's direct. If your snake bump into the border or itself, the game will end.
